# Culinary Connect
This is my Phase 1 End Project The Culinary Connect is up and running!! Using this webpage,users will be able to get recipes based on their tastes,prefrences and allergies online for free without the hussle of looking everywhere for it.

# Project by Jonathan
This project was created and is sole property of Jonathan Mutinda,

# Description
The app allows the user to see the recipe in detail from the ingredients to how to make it and finally how many people it plans on serving. It also provides the user with a video for those better suited for visual learning. The user can also see a menu of all the recipes on the page. The user can get as many recipes as they like base on their prefrence with as much as a picture to help visualise what the end product should be.
